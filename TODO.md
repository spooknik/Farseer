# Farseer - UI/UX Improvement Ideas

## Quick Wins

- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts** - Add shortcuts like `Ctrl+Shift+T` for new connection, `Ctrl+W` to close tab, `Ctrl+Tab` to switch tabs
- [ ] **Connection quick-connect** - A "Quick Connect" option in the sidebar to connect to a host without saving it first
- [ ] **Drag and drop file uploads** - Allow dragging files directly onto the terminal or file manager
- [ ] **Double-click to connect** - Currently single-click connects; could use single-click to select, double-click to connect
- [ ] **Confirm before closing tab** - Show a confirmation when closing an active session
- [ ] **Last connected indicator** - Show which machines were recently used, maybe sort by last connected

## Visual Polish

- [ ] **Favicon that reflects connection status** - Change the browser tab icon when connected/disconnected
- [ ] **Better empty states** - More helpful prompts when there are no machines or groups
- [ ] **Toast notifications** - Show non-blocking notifications for events like "Connection lost", "File uploaded"
- [ ] **Dark/light theme toggle** - Some users prefer light mode
- [ ] **Terminal font size control** - Allow users to adjust terminal font size

## File Manager

- [ ] **Breadcrumb navigation** - Show clickable path segments instead of just the full path
